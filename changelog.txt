    * Scale color schemes changed to use a global setting rather than individually per sub-basin scale for more consistent color experience
        > Hotkey: "c"
        > Note: does not apply to basins saved before this update due to how scale saving works, thus their colors are locked
    * "Wiki" scale color scheme again updated to new Wikipedia colors
        > Old colors preserved as "Wiki (Pre-2023/HHW)" (includes some colors for hypothetical extended Saffir-Simpson categories)

v20190827d:
    * Limited "Starting year" selector to only allow years within the valid range of the Javascript Dates
v20190827c:
    * Fixed bug where 0001 B.C.E. (or 0002-01 B.C.E.) in the "Starting year" selector doesn't work and the basin uses the default instead
v20190827b:
    * Made the crash screen a little better
v20190827a:
    * The "Starting year" selector in the New Basin Settings menu now uses a text input box to make selecting a year easier
        > Accepts both valid NHem and SHem years (regardless of hemisphere selected with the button above)
        > Can use "B.C.E.", "BCE", "BC", "b.c.", etc. for years prior to 1 C.E. ("A.D.", "ce", "C.E.", etc. also treated as valid)
        > SHem years accept both two-digit and full year numbers after the "-" as valid as long as it represents the year following the one before the "-"
        > A variant of "B.C.E." may be used before the "-" in a SHem year for the special case of 0001 B.C.E.-01 C.E. ("C.E." before "-" is invalid however)
        > Any invalid year value may be used to return to the default "Current year"
    * Dates before year 1 are now displayed with "B.C.E." instead of a negative number
    * Fixed broken SHem years before "-1-00" (0002-01 B.C.E.)
v20190823a:
    * NCMetadata class replaced with EnvNoiseChannel, which allows more efficient loading of environmental field data
    * "Activity Modes" are now "Simulation Modes" (still referred to by the old name in much of the code)
    * Environmental fields now defined in env-defs.js in a more flexible manner for future changes and simulation modes
        > Field definitions among simulation modes are now laid out more neatly
        > Console hacks to environmental fields are now a bit easier due to the removal of closures from the map functions and the addition of modifiers
        > The new 'u' utility mini-class offers tools for use in map functions
        > Modifiers allow the use of a single map function for multiple simulation modes without cluttering the function with conditionals
    * Environmental fields are now versioned so that future algorithm changes may flag older basins' histories as inaccurate
    * Saves upgraded to format 3, which more flexibly stores environmental field data along with versioning
v20190810a:
    + Added two "Periodic Table" name lists
        > The regular one is a continuously looping list
        > The "(Annual)" list resets at the beginning of each year
v20190809a:
    * Attempted fix to land being low-res and pixelated in fullscreen after a basin is loaded while a mobile device is in portrait orientation
v20190808a:
    * Land, snow, and shader now initially render at full display resolution upon basin loading, and no longer re-render upon fullscreen switches

        > Switching in and out of fullscreen is now a lot faster
v20190807a:
    * Fixed awful copy-paste fail in the PAGASA name list (won't fix existing basins)
v20190804b:
    * Fixed tropical waves not spawning in megablobs mode
v20190804a:
    + Added new activity mode: Megablobs
        > Similar to normal mode, but with SST anomaly blobs that can reach extremely high temperatures (more-so than wild mode)
        > Jetstream displaced a little poleward similarly to hyper mode
    + Added the magnifying glass, which allows a more high-resolution view of environmental map layers around the pointer
        > Can be enabled/disabled from the settings menu, or by pressing "m"
    * Changed color scheme for the SST map layer
        > Colors for temperatures up to 32C are now more similar to the color scheme of the graphics on Levi Cowan's tropicaltidbits.com website
        > Colors for "hypothetical" temperatures beyond the above scale added particularly for megablobs mode
        > Below 0 = white, 0-10 = white to blue, 10-20 = blue to cyan, 20-26 = cyan to green
        > 26-29 = yellow to red, 29-34 = red to very light pink, 34-40 = very light pink to very light lime
        > 40-50 = shades of lime ligher to darker, 50-75 = shades of creamsicle darker to lighter

v20190721a:
    + Added Hebrew alphabet to Atlantic and Eastern Pacific name lists for use after the Greek alphabet
        > Only applies to new basins
        > Technically not an official part of those name lists in the real world, but useful for extreme hyperactivity in this simulator
    * Land is now calculated at twice the normal resolution of the 540p canvas, thus rendering nicely in 1080p in fullscreen
v20190718b:
    * Fixed graphical glitch where Atlantic out-basin coloration sticks after returning to main menu and loading another basin
v20190718a:
    * Attempt at fixing a bug with the Atlantic map on HiDPI displays

    * ActiveSystem class no longer relies on 'basin' as a global variable
v20190713a:
    + Added a third activity mode: Wild
        > Features a weird season climatology where SSTs are more random and steering is drunken for part of the season
        > Storms can form in nearly any watery location on the map
        > Season is generally longer and more active than normal
        > July in NHem (January in SHem) is very dry with high SSTs
    * 'Hyper' activity mode is now called 'OP'

v20190702a:
    + Added hypothetical categories (C6-C10 and hypercanes)
        > Optionally enabled upon basin creation
        > C8+ and hypercanes kept track of in season stats
        > Can be spawned in god mode
v20190630a:
    + Added ability to save basins with a custom name using a text box
    * Finished the full switch from localStorage to indexedDB
        > Basins and seasons are now stored in indexedDB
        > Saving no longer limited by the localStorage 5 MB limit (Cyclone Sim can now theoretically save up to 10% of drive space)
    * You can now save an unlimited number of basins
        > Load menu UI updated with pages
    * Saved basins and seasons upgraded to Format 2, which is more efficient and less hacky than the localStorage-limited Format 1
v20190622a:
    * Mostly prepared the simulator for asynchronous saving/loading which will come later with the full transition to indexedDB
    * Some tweaks to input UI
v20190617a:
    * Mostly finished text input UI code for text boxes to be added in later updates
v20190615a:

v20190613a:
    + Added partial support for indexedDB saving/loading
        > Currently only used to store settings, while localStorage is still used for basins and seasons
        > Full transition coming in a later update
    + Added new waiting screen (with animated loading ring) for asynchronous tasks
        > Not used for rendering as that is single-threaded
    * Various code optimizations for the upcoming switch to storing basins and seasons in indexedDB
    % Added Dexie.js for an easier indexedDB API
v20190606a:
    + Added NIO, SWIO, SPac, SAtl, Jakarta, and Port Moresby name lists
        > Jakarta and Port Moresby lists are not included in Aus, but completely separate lists for now
    + Added "No Tracks" track mode
    * Updated WPac list preset to reflect the retirement and replacement of 2017 storm names
        > Only affects newly created basins
    * Fixed a couple track updating bugs:
        > New track segments getting drawn for non-selected storms while a storm is selected
        > Tracks not getting refreshed when the track mode setting button is clicked
v20190531b:
    * Season summary timelines now use Greek letters for storms with Greek letter names

        > Pardon me mobile users; I'll add an alternative spawning method eventually
v20190525a:
    * Changed how natural storm system spawning works
        > Systems (both extratropical and tropical waves) can now spawn at any longitude
        > Extratropical systems spawn along the jetstream
        > Tropical waves still have a 20% tendency to spawn at the eastern edge
        > Tropical waves no longer spawn nearly as often during off-season
        > Systems in general spawn more frequently
    * Rotating a mobile device between portrait and landscape now toggles fullscreen mode (?)
    * Storms slightly less impacted by land interaction (still needs work)
v20190518a:
    + Added button in new basin settings menu to control if god mode (user able to spawn storms) is enabled/disabled
        > Previously always enabled by default, but now the default setting for new basins is disabled
    * Cleaned up Basin constructor code to better accomodate new options

v20190424a:
    * Pressing "F11" now toggles fullscreen mode
v20190423a:
    + Added Central Continent map type

v20190217a:
    + Added track display modes, currently accessed by pressing the "T" key (mobile-friendly UI coming later)
        > There are 3 modes as of this update, which the "T" key cycles through

v20181222a:
    + Added a basic test for basin saving/loading
        > Saves just the seed of the latest basin generated
        > The "'Load' From Seed (test)" button uses the saved seed to generate a new basin (does nothing if no seed is saved)
v20181218a:
    + Added a basin setting for the starting year of a simulation
        > The default of "Current year" is the current Jan-Dec year for NHem and Jul-Jun year for SHem

    * Fujiwhara improvements
v20181028a:
    + Added a "Start" button when the sim loads, which will initialize the sim upon being clicked
        > This is to help make things load faster, but is also for future user-customizable basin UI
    + Added graphical rendering for environmental fields
        > Both plain-value and vector-based fields supported, rendering with colored tiles and arrows respectively
        > Press "E" to rotate through the environmental fields, and back to "none"
        > Currently, steering is the only environmental field, so "E" is more of a toggle for now
    * Optimized the environmental field code for future environmental factors, including adding vector support for current steering
        > Steering may have gotten yet more drunk for now
v20181026b:
    * Fixed SHem steering behaving even more drunk than the NHem already is
        > Both hemispheres still drunk; just SHem isn't as drunk
v20181026a:
    + Crikey mate! Added the southern hemisphere
        > No whole-world added yet, so a basin is just one hemisphere or the other; 50/50 chance at generation
    + Added a 'basin' object and moved some variables there for future saving/loading and user management of basin settings
    * Now displays "Land rendering..." while the land is rendering instead of holding the page in a loading cycle
v20181024b:
    + Added snow that changes with the time of year for aesthetics
        > Snow depends on both elevation and latitude to give a realistic look

    * Fujiwhara tweaked to make stronger storms and extratropical systems more "dominant" in the interaction
    * Simulation speed now works in powers of 2, with a 6th speed option added

    * Changed canvas dimensions to 960x540 as to fit a 16:9 aspect ratio
    - Temporarily removed subtropical storms
        > System behavior hasn't yet changed, but they're just classified as extratropical, thus expect E5s
v20180810a:
    + Added clickable UI elements/buttons, opening the door for more possibilities in this sim along with better mobile compatibility
    + Added a pause button, which works alongside the existing "space"
        > The indicator text also functions as an extension of the pause button when a storm isn't selected
    + Added a date navigator UI, which can be accessed by clicking the time in the upper left
        > Using the arrow buttons, you can jump through analysis by the year, month, day, or advisory increment (6 hours)
        > The arrow keys still work alongside this new UI
    + Added rudimentary seasonal activity; storms should now be more common and stronger in September than in January

v20180731a:
    + Added environmental steering; may need some work
    * Some adjustments to storm strength algorithm
    * Spawning frequency and ranges adjusted

        > Press "[" to slow the simulation down and "]" to speed the simulation up
    + Added indicator in the upper-right (when a storm is not selected) for simulation speed and if the sim is paused
v20180728a:
    + Added subtropical and extratropical storms
        > Spawn extratropical systems with "x"; subtropical storms cannot yet be spawned
    + Added pressure; wind speed is now based on pressure
    + Added a temporary environmental gradient for determining extratropical vs. subtropical vs. tropical
    + Added clicking storms to select them; selected storms appear with a white outline and display info in the upper-right
    + Added all 6 name lists plus Greek alphabet, which should rotate appropriately through a 6-year cycle
    * Big refactor to make more-efficient classes for future saving and loading basins
    * "Lows" are now specifically "tropical waves" as opposed to extratropical lows
    * Storms now spawn in one of two locations based on if they're extratropical or a tropical wave
    * Strengthening/weakening algorithm changed significantly for handling new extratropical and subtropical systems
v20180721a:
    + Added analysis, allowing you to see history of the sim by pausing and pressing the left and right arrow keys to move forward and backward through time
        > Unpause (or press "A" for single-tick advance) to return the time to the present without spamming the right arrow key
    + Added some code for "seasons" (quite unfinished)
    + Added lows, which are anything below 20 mph, which was where storms died before
        > Storms now die when they drop below 0 mph
        > Hold "L" and click to spawn a low
    * Tracks now disappear as soon as a storm dies, but it can still be seen in analysis
    * Storm icons are now rendered with a method of the StormSystem class to make analysis work more easily
v20180719a:
    * Fixed mouse events blocking default browser actions when cursor is outside the canvas, which made it impossible to access the changelog using the link (sorry)
    * Fixed first segment of tracks not rendering immediately
v20180718b:
    * Storms are for now named with a continuously looping 2022 Atlantic hurricane name list (Will be changed)
    * Tracks are no longer rendered every frame, but only when needed, making the sim run faster
    - Removed tracks dissappearing when the framerate drops below 25 fps, as it's no longer needed thanks to the improvement above
v20180718a:
    + Added names:
        > Depressions recieve a number with the suffix "H" for "Hypothetical"
        > Named storms are all named "Unnamed", as this is incomplete
    + Added code for environment factors such as "shear" and "SSTAnomaly", but are not in use yet
    * Changed each simulation tick from 30 minutes to an hour:
        > Storms now move twice as fast as seen by the viewer, although they move at the same speed in simulation time
        > Strengthening/weakening code is still the same per-tick, so behavior has changed somewhat
    * The time in the upper left uses a slightly different format now
    * Fixed keyboard events blocking default browser actions like "F5" for reload or "F12" for javascript console, except in cases involving keys used for the simulation ("space" doesn't scroll the page down)
v20180713a:
    + Added pausing using "space"
    + Added a date counter; currently serves no purpose
    + Added spawning using the keyboard and mouse:
        > Hold "D" and click to spawn a tropical depression
        > Hold "S" and click to spawn a tropical storm
        > Hold "1" and click to spawn a category 1 hurricane
        > So on for keys "2" through "5"
    + Added stepping one frame (30 sim-minutes) at a time while paused using "A"
    + Added a method to display storms' windspeeds underneath them, enabled using "W"

    * Changed rendering so storm symbols always render above tracks
    * Slight tweak to storm strength calculation besides land interaction
v20180709a:
    + Initially created a simple hurricane simulator without much regard to realism, nor any land
    % Using p5.js for the first time for any of my experiments
