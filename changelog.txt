        > replaces old hardcoded Saffir-Simpson scale with something more flexible and customizable
        > sub-basin-specific and saved/loaded with basin
        > allows for different color schemes and "flavors" of nomenclature
    + Added "Wiki" color scheme
        > uses Wikipedia category colors for storm icons/tracks/timeline bars
        > C6+ colors in Extended Saffir-Simpson scale sourced from Hypothetical Hurricanes Wiki
        > can be accessed with the "Scale Color Scheme" option in New Basin Settings
    * "Hypothetical Categories" option replaced with Extended Saffir-Simpson scale

v0.1.1.1 (b20200202c):
    * Fixed bug where storms that go off the edge of the map as an in-basin TC remain "currently active" and glitch the timeline after the season ends
v0.1.1 (b20200202b):
    * Season timelines now pack better and take the width of the label into account
    * Timeline bars can now be clicked to bring up that storm's info in the side panel
        > Individual storm timelines not yet added
    * The "Jump to" button for TCs now jumps to when the storm entered the basin or formed rather than when it initially spawned as a disturbance
v0.1 (b20200202a):
    + Added CPac and PAGASA designation-systems for newly-created EPac and WPac map type basins respectively
    * Sub-basins and designation-systems now fully implemented for storm statistics and naming
        > No UI yet to see statistics for sub-basins other than the main basin, but the stats are saved
    * Tracks now include out-basin portions for in-basin storms
    * Side-panel "Dates active" info for storms now notes if a storm has entered or left the basin

    * Old name list system replaced with DesignationSystem objects to allow more flexible numbering and naming
        > Still WIP and doesn't yet have all the intended flexibility
    * Basins now given a main SubBasin for the implementation of DesignationSystem
        > Other sub-basins such as PAGASA are still planned for a future update
    * Storms are no longer named "Unnamed" when names are exhausted, but just continue using their number
v20200101a:
    * Slight code changes to set up upcoming scale system
v20191231a:
    * Updated South-West Indian Ocean names for the 2021-22 list
    * Some other under-the-hood changes
v20191109a:
    * Fixed season summary track mode including:
        > storms from previous years whose remnants lasted into the relevant year
        > storms from following years whose precursors formed during the relevant year
    * Fixed timelines not updating after the end of the year without having to view a different season's timeline first
    * Fixed out-basin storms being included in damage, deaths, and landfall stats
v20191004a:
    + Added "designations" system for more flexible and robust storm numbering and naming
        > Includes support for secondary (PAGASA-style) names (though currently not implemented)
        > Includes support for designations prior to TC formation (Invests) (Also not yet implemented)
v20191003a:
    + Added "Experimental" simulation mode
        > Currently a normal mode clone with very extreme SSTs
        > Expect it to frequently change as it will be used for testing purposes
    * env-defs.js is now sim-mode-defs.js to better encompass what it is for
    * each simulation mode's wave/ET spawning function is defined in sim-mode-defs.js now instead of directly in the Basin.advanceSim method
    * renamed simulation-mode-related constants
    * out-basin now based on a "subBasin number" and a Basin.subBasins object (partial addition of upcoming sub-basins system)
v20190911a:
    + Added a landfall counter to storm and season stats
v20190827d:
    * Limited "Starting year" selector to only allow years within the valid range of the Javascript Dates
v20190827c:
    * Fixed bug where 0001 B.C.E. (or 0002-01 B.C.E.) in the "Starting year" selector doesn't work and the basin uses the default instead
v20190827b:
    * Made the crash screen a little better
v20190827a:
    * The "Starting year" selector in the New Basin Settings menu now uses a text input box to make selecting a year easier
        > Accepts both valid NHem and SHem years (regardless of hemisphere selected with the button above)
        > Can use "B.C.E.", "BCE", "BC", "b.c.", etc. for years prior to 1 C.E. ("A.D.", "ce", "C.E.", etc. also treated as valid)
        > SHem years accept both two-digit and full year numbers after the "-" as valid as long as it represents the year following the one before the "-"
        > A variant of "B.C.E." may be used before the "-" in a SHem year for the special case of 0001 B.C.E.-01 C.E. ("C.E." before "-" is invalid however)
        > Any invalid year value may be used to return to the default "Current year"
    * Dates before year 1 are now displayed with "B.C.E." instead of a negative number
    * Fixed broken SHem years before "-1-00" (0002-01 B.C.E.)
v20190823a:
    * NCMetadata class replaced with EnvNoiseChannel, which allows more efficient loading of environmental field data
    * "Activity Modes" are now "Simulation Modes" (still referred to by the old name in much of the code)
    * Environmental fields now defined in env-defs.js in a more flexible manner for future changes and simulation modes
        > Field definitions among simulation modes are now laid out more neatly
        > Console hacks to environmental fields are now a bit easier due to the removal of closures from the map functions and the addition of modifiers
        > The new 'u' utility mini-class offers tools for use in map functions
        > Modifiers allow the use of a single map function for multiple simulation modes without cluttering the function with conditionals
    * Environmental fields are now versioned so that future algorithm changes may flag older basins' histories as inaccurate
    * Saves upgraded to format 3, which more flexibly stores environmental field data along with versioning
v20190810a:
    + Added two "Periodic Table" name lists
        > The regular one is a continuously looping list
        > The "(Annual)" list resets at the beginning of each year
v20190809a:
    * Attempted fix to land being low-res and pixelated in fullscreen after a basin is loaded while a mobile device is in portrait orientation
v20190808a:
    * Land, snow, and shader now initially render at full display resolution upon basin loading, and no longer re-render upon fullscreen switches
        > Is not hi-res in normal view since it is automatically resized down
        > Switching in and out of fullscreen is now a lot faster
v20190807a:
    * Fixed awful copy-paste fail in the PAGASA name list (won't fix existing basins)
v20190804b:
    * Fixed tropical waves not spawning in megablobs mode
v20190804a:
    + Added new activity mode: Megablobs
        > Similar to normal mode, but with SST anomaly blobs that can reach extremely high temperatures (more-so than wild mode)
        > Jetstream displaced a little poleward similarly to hyper mode
    + Added the magnifying glass, which allows a more high-resolution view of environmental map layers around the pointer
        > Can be enabled/disabled from the settings menu, or by pressing "m"
    * Changed color scheme for the SST map layer
        > Colors for temperatures up to 32C are now more similar to the color scheme of the graphics on Levi Cowan's tropicaltidbits.com website
        > Colors for "hypothetical" temperatures beyond the above scale added particularly for megablobs mode
        > Below 0 = white, 0-10 = white to blue, 10-20 = blue to cyan, 20-26 = cyan to green
        > 26-29 = yellow to red, 29-34 = red to very light pink, 34-40 = very light pink to very light lime
        > 40-50 = shades of lime ligher to darker, 50-75 = shades of creamsicle darker to lighter

        > Technically not an official part of those name lists in the real world, but useful for extreme hyperactivity in this simulator
    * Land is now calculated at twice the normal resolution of the 540p canvas, thus rendering nicely in 1080p in fullscreen
v20190718b:
    * Fixed graphical glitch where Atlantic out-basin coloration sticks after returning to main menu and loading another basin
v20190718a:
    * Attempt at fixing a bug with the Atlantic map on HiDPI displays

v20190714a:
    * Renamed 'OP' activity mode back to 'Hyper' cuz it was sad
    * ActiveSystem class no longer relies on 'basin' as a global variable
v20190713a:
    + Added a third activity mode: Wild
        > Features a weird season climatology where SSTs are more random and steering is drunken for part of the season
        > Storms can form in nearly any watery location on the map
        > Season is generally longer and more active than normal
        > July in NHem (January in SHem) is very dry with high SSTs

v20190702a:
    + Added hypothetical categories (C6-C10 and hypercanes)
        > Optionally enabled upon basin creation
        > C8+ and hypercanes kept track of in season stats
        > Can be spawned in god mode
v20190630a:
    + Added ability to save basins with a custom name using a text box
    * Finished the full switch from localStorage to indexedDB

    * You can now save an unlimited number of basins
        > Load menu UI updated with pages
    * Saved basins and seasons upgraded to Format 2, which is more efficient and less hacky than the localStorage-limited Format 1

    + Added partial support for indexedDB saving/loading
        > Currently only used to store settings, while localStorage is still used for basins and seasons
        > Full transition coming in a later update
    + Added new waiting screen (with animated loading ring) for asynchronous tasks
        > Not used for rendering as that is single-threaded
    * Various code optimizations for the upcoming switch to storing basins and seasons in indexedDB
    % Added Dexie.js for an easier indexedDB API
v20190606a:
    + Added NIO, SWIO, SPac, SAtl, Jakarta, and Port Moresby name lists
        > Jakarta and Port Moresby lists are not included in Aus, but completely separate lists for now
    + Added "No Tracks" track mode
    * Updated WPac list preset to reflect the retirement and replacement of 2017 storm names
        > Only affects newly created basins
    * Fixed a couple track updating bugs:
        > New track segments getting drawn for non-selected storms while a storm is selected
        > Tracks not getting refreshed when the track mode setting button is clicked

v20190525a:
    * Changed how natural storm system spawning works
        > Systems (both extratropical and tropical waves) can now spawn at any longitude
        > Extratropical systems spawn along the jetstream
        > Tropical waves still have a 20% tendency to spawn at the eastern edge
        > Tropical waves no longer spawn nearly as often during off-season
        > Systems in general spawn more frequently
    * Rotating a mobile device between portrait and landscape now toggles fullscreen mode (?)
    * Storms slightly less impacted by land interaction (still needs work)
v20190518a:
    + Added button in new basin settings menu to control if god mode (user able to spawn storms) is enabled/disabled
        > Previously always enabled by default, but now the default setting for new basins is disabled

v20190411a:
    + Added settings menu
        > Accessible from main menu and within a sim basin
        > Currently only includes settings for intensity indicators, autosaving, and track mode
    * Settings added to settings menu are now saved and preserved between reloads (e.g. intensity indicators no longer need to be enabled with every page load)
    * Simulation is automatically paused when loading a saved basin, but still starts unpaused for newly created basins
    * Main rendering and click actions (storm selection/spawning) for basins now tied to primaryWrapper UI element
    * Another attempt to fix the high-density display graphical bug

    * Fixed a corruption bug with the numerical array compression function
v20190305a:
    + Added 5 additional save slots for saved basins (besides autosave slot 0)

    * Small change to saved basin localStorage keys to accomodate future sim options
    * As a test, seasons are "saved" to the global variable testSavedSeasons during basin autosaves
        > They aren't actually saved to localStorage and loading the saved basin test is still the same as before
v20190217a:
    + Added track display modes, currently accessed by pressing the "T" key (mobile-friendly UI coming later)
        > There are 3 modes as of this update, which the "T" key cycles through
            > The first mode shows the tracks from first tropical formation to last tropical dissipation of systems active at the viewed tick
            > The second mode shows the full tracks of all systems active at the viewed tick, including extratropical systems
            > The third mode shows the tracks from first tropical formation to last tropical dissipation of all systems in the viewed season ("Season track display mode")
    * Capped storm icon rotation speed for storms exceeding 270 kts
v20190216a:
    + Added saving/loading methods for the StormData class

        > Atl and EPac lists behave per year; WPac and Aus lists are sequential regardless of year (just as you'd expect)
    * Hurricane-strength tropical cyclones now come in 3 flavors: Cyclone, Hurricane, and Typhoon
        > Currently tied to the selected name list; to be made its own option later
v20190206b:

    + Added a couple functions for data compression purposes for saving/loading
v20181222a:
    + Added a basic test for basin saving/loading
        > Saves just the seed of the latest basin generated
        > The "'Load' From Seed (test)" button uses the saved seed to generate a new basin (does nothing if no seed is saved)
v20181218a:
    + Added a basin setting for the starting year of a simulation
        > The default of "Current year" is the current Jan-Dec year for NHem and Jul-Jun year for SHem
v20181217a:
    + Added damage and deaths, including counters in storm and season stats
        > The damage/deaths algorithm is rudimentary and may need change
v20181216a:
    + Added "Total ACE" counter to season stats
v20181215a:
    + Added "Jump to" button to side panel, which (while paused) "jumps" analysis to a specific point

        > Now has its own "target" storm that changes in tandem upon clicking a storm icon
    * Fixed glitch with mouse-hover over overlapping UI elements
v20181201a:
    + Added an "extended storm info" UI box accessible by clicking the info text in the upper right while a storm is selected

    + Added wind shear environmental field
    + Added new "coast outline" rendering for land for moisture field
    * Large change to storm algorithm to make seasons less hyperactive and somewhat more realistic
        > Looks to need to be ironed out quite a bit over the next few verisons
v20181111a:
    * Big improvement to upper-level steering to make it less drunk and more realistic
v20181110a:
    + Added a currently-very-drunken upper-level steering field
    * Storm steering algorithm changed to follow both upper and lower-level steering based on strength and if extratropical
        > True "wind shear" not quite added yet as storms don't yet weaken
v20181109b:
    + Readded environmental wobble
    * Optimized environmental fields for future saving & loading of basins
v20181109a:
    * Changed snow-rendering algorithm for faster and more efficient rendering
v20181105a:
    + Added code for a graphical shader that gives land some shadows and visible depth
        > Disabled until user settings are added since it increases render times
    * Adjustments to SST anomalies to use a more logarithmic system, and have greater anomalies closer to the poles
    * Definition SST values for equatorward and poleward edges at peak-season and peak-off-season moved to constants.js
v20181102a:
    * Reworked land to work more efficiently with cleaner code
    * SST map layers now render more nicely with the land and are now less laggy when the sim is running
    * Clicking the map layer text/button in the bottom now rotates through the map layers
    * The data displayed in the map layer button now shows that at the position of the selected storm if one is selected
        > includes indicator for if the data is "@ mouse pointer / finger" or "@ selected storm"
        > if the selected storm is not active at the time viewed in analysis, data for the mouse pointer / finger is displayed

    * "E" now rotates through 3 environmental fields: LLSteering, SSTAnomaly, and SST
v20181030a:
    * Steering is now much less drunk
    * Fujiwhara improvements
v20181028a:
    + Added a "Start" button when the sim loads, which will initialize the sim upon being clicked
        > This is to help make things load faster, but is also for future user-customizable basin UI
    + Added graphical rendering for environmental fields
        > Both plain-value and vector-based fields supported, rendering with colored tiles and arrows respectively
        > Press "E" to rotate through the environmental fields, and back to "none"
        > Currently, steering is the only environmental field, so "E" is more of a toggle for now
    * Optimized the environmental field code for future environmental factors, including adding vector support for current steering
        > Steering may have gotten yet more drunk for now
v20181026b:
    * Fixed SHem steering behaving even more drunk than the NHem already is
        > Both hemispheres still drunk; just SHem isn't as drunk
v20181026a:
    + Crikey mate! Added the southern hemisphere
        > No whole-world added yet, so a basin is just one hemisphere or the other; 50/50 chance at generation
    + Added a 'basin' object and moved some variables there for future saving/loading and user management of basin settings
    * Now displays "Land rendering..." while the land is rendering instead of holding the page in a loading cycle
v20181024b:
    + Added snow that changes with the time of year for aesthetics
        > Snow depends on both elevation and latitude to give a realistic look
    * Cleaned up code for colors so they're actually defined in constants.js, and made land colors less hardcoded
v20181024a:
    * Changed land colors to make land look better
    * Changed how selected storm outlines are drawn to make them look better
    * Split the code into multiple files to begin some cleanup and refactoring
    * Some attempt at fixing subtropical cyclones so they're less nonexistant
    * Slightly lowered spawn rate
    * Land generation is now seeded with the time, which is stored in a "seed" variable
v20181015a:
    + Added a makeshift "track forecast" to selected storms; yellow dots show where the storm might go (is often wrong!)
v20181014a:
    * Fujiwhara tweaked to make stronger storms and extratropical systems more "dominant" in the interaction
    * Simulation speed now works in powers of 2, with a 6th speed option added
        > Full-Speed, Half-Speed, 1/4 Speed, 1/8 Speed, 1/16 Speed, and 1/32 Speed
    * When a storm is selected, only the selected storm's track shows
v20181013a:
    + Readded subtropical storms, using different mechanics
    + Added fujiwhara interaction (Might need tweaking)
    * Changed C4 and C5 colors
    * Analysis now shows all systems, tropical and not, throughout a season
    * Only TCs now show tracks, including precursors and remnants
v20181004a:
    * Made steering completely drunk for the moment (will be fixed)
    * Changed canvas dimensions to 960x540 as to fit a 16:9 aspect ratio
    - Temporarily removed subtropical storms
        > System behavior hasn't yet changed, but they're just classified as extratropical, thus expect E5s
v20180810a:
    + Added clickable UI elements/buttons, opening the door for more possibilities in this sim along with better mobile compatibility
    + Added a pause button, which works alongside the existing "space"
        > The indicator text also functions as an extension of the pause button when a storm isn't selected
    + Added a date navigator UI, which can be accessed by clicking the time in the upper left
        > Using the arrow buttons, you can jump through analysis by the year, month, day, or advisory increment (6 hours)
        > The arrow keys still work alongside this new UI
    + Added rudimentary seasonal activity; storms should now be more common and stronger in September than in January
    * Some tweaks to steering
v20180731a:
    + Added environmental steering; may need some work
    * Some adjustments to storm strength algorithm
    * Spawning frequency and ranges adjusted
v20180729a:
    + Storms now keep track of their peak intensity (by pressure), including all associated data at the point of peak intensity
    + Added ACE
    * Inactive selected storms now display their full name as of peak intensity, plus ACE
    * You can now hold down the arrow keys in analysis to quickly move backwards and forwards
v20180728b:
    + Added 5 different simulation speed levels: Full-Speed, Half-Speed, 1/3 Speed, 1/4 Speed, and 1/5 Speed
        > Press "[" to slow the simulation down and "]" to speed the simulation up
    + Added indicator in the upper-right (when a storm is not selected) for simulation speed and if the sim is paused
v20180728a:
    + Added subtropical and extratropical storms
        > Spawn extratropical systems with "x"; subtropical storms cannot yet be spawned
    + Added pressure; wind speed is now based on pressure
    + Added a temporary environmental gradient for determining extratropical vs. subtropical vs. tropical
    + Added clicking storms to select them; selected storms appear with a white outline and display info in the upper-right
    + Added all 6 name lists plus Greek alphabet, which should rotate appropriately through a 6-year cycle
    * Big refactor to make more-efficient classes for future saving and loading basins
    * "Lows" are now specifically "tropical waves" as opposed to extratropical lows
    * Storms now spawn in one of two locations based on if they're extratropical or a tropical wave
    * Strengthening/weakening algorithm changed significantly for handling new extratropical and subtropical systems
v20180721a:
    + Added analysis, allowing you to see history of the sim by pausing and pressing the left and right arrow keys to move forward and backward through time
        > Unpause (or press "A" for single-tick advance) to return the time to the present without spamming the right arrow key
    + Added some code for "seasons" (quite unfinished)
    + Added lows, which are anything below 20 mph, which was where storms died before
        > Storms now die when they drop below 0 mph
        > Hold "L" and click to spawn a low
    * Tracks now disappear as soon as a storm dies, but it can still be seen in analysis
    * Storm icons are now rendered with a method of the StormSystem class to make analysis work more easily
v20180719a:
    * Fixed mouse events blocking default browser actions when cursor is outside the canvas, which made it impossible to access the changelog using the link (sorry)
    * Fixed first segment of tracks not rendering immediately
v20180718b:
    * Storms are for now named with a continuously looping 2022 Atlantic hurricane name list (Will be changed)
    * Tracks are no longer rendered every frame, but only when needed, making the sim run faster
    - Removed tracks dissappearing when the framerate drops below 25 fps, as it's no longer needed thanks to the improvement above
v20180718a:
    + Added names:
        > Depressions recieve a number with the suffix "H" for "Hypothetical"
        > Named storms are all named "Unnamed", as this is incomplete
    + Added code for environment factors such as "shear" and "SSTAnomaly", but are not in use yet
    * Changed each simulation tick from 30 minutes to an hour:
        > Storms now move twice as fast as seen by the viewer, although they move at the same speed in simulation time
        > Strengthening/weakening code is still the same per-tick, so behavior has changed somewhat
    * The time in the upper left uses a slightly different format now
    * Fixed keyboard events blocking default browser actions like "F5" for reload or "F12" for javascript console, except in cases involving keys used for the simulation ("space" doesn't scroll the page down)
v20180713a:
    + Added pausing using "space"
    + Added a date counter; currently serves no purpose
    + Added spawning using the keyboard and mouse:
        > Hold "D" and click to spawn a tropical depression
        > Hold "S" and click to spawn a tropical storm
        > Hold "1" and click to spawn a category 1 hurricane
        > So on for keys "2" through "5"
    + Added stepping one frame (30 sim-minutes) at a time while paused using "A"
    + Added a method to display storms' windspeeds underneath them, enabled using "W"
    * Changed land rendering to better show height
    * Fixed(?) issues involving higher-definition display devices
    * Tracks of dead storms now disappear whenever the framerate drops below 25 fps, not just after their timeout
    * Changed canvas dimensions to 1100x500
    * Tweaked land generation
    % Added moment.js for date and time calculations and display
v20180712a:
    + Added land, which weakens storms
    * Made tracks thicker
    * Actually added the CSS and version number to make this consistent with my other experiments
    * Changed rendering so storm symbols always render above tracks
    * Slight tweak to storm strength calculation besides land interaction
v20180709a:
    + Initially created a simple hurricane simulator without much regard to realism, nor any land
    % Using p5.js for the first time for any of my experiments
